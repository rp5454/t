Yes — much more.
NFRP is not just a reporting or dashboard backend.
It automates core finance functions that would otherwise be done manually by finance users.

A. Revenue calculation & allocation

What a finance analyst would do manually:

Pull revenue from multiple systems

Allocate revenue to:

entities

products

functions

Adjust for corrections

👉 NFRP does this systematically and repeatably

B. Tax calculation & consolidation

Manual work replaced by NFRP:

Apply tax rules

Consolidate across entities

Exclude non-taxable items

Prepare tax-ready numbers

👉 That’s why you see:

CALC_CONSOL_TAX

Exclusions like Operating Profit, PAT

C. Period closing activities

Manual close tasks:

Freeze periods

Ensure no late postings

Validate totals

👉 NFRP enforces:

Period boundaries

Cut-off logic

Restart-safe closing

D. Restatement & audit adjustment

Manual reality in finance:

Auditors ask for corrections

Past numbers must change

Proof of change required

👉 NFRP:

Recalculates safely

Logs every change

Preserves audit trail


So what exactly is NFRP if it’s not an app or API?

This is the key clarity:

NFRP is a governed financial processing platform built entirely inside the SAP HANA database.

In simple words:

❌ Not a UI app

❌ Not an API product

❌ Not a dashboard tool

✅ A data-centric finance engine

Think of NFRP as:
Comparison	Meaning
Excel macros	❌ Too small
ERP UI	❌ Too interactive
Backend service	❌ No API
Financial calculation engine	✅ YES
Batch processing system	✅ YES

It lives in:

Stored procedures

Tables

Parameters

Schedulers

Logs

4️⃣ Why does PSS “manually run SQL” then?

This is very common in enterprise finance and not a weakness.

Important distinction
Who	What they do
Finance users	Never touch SQL
Dashboards	Auto-refresh
Schedulers	Run daily/monthly jobs
PSS team	Control, validate, recover
Why manual SQL execution exists

PSS runs SQL to:

Diagnose failures

Validate counts

Trigger ad-hoc restatements

Verify data readiness

Recover after incidents

👉 This is operational control, not normal usage.

Analogy (very important)

Pilots normally fly with autopilot

Engineers manually intervene only when required

PSS = Engineers
Schedulers = Autopilot
NFRP = Aircraft system

In short, NFRP is a database-native financial processing and restatement platform that automates core finance calculations—such as
revenue, tax, consolidation, and period closing—using governed batch logic, while allowing controlled manual intervention by the PSS team for validation, recovery, and audit support.

Why this design actually makes sense

Finance systems prioritize:

Correctness over convenience

Control over UI

Auditability over speed

That’s why NFRP:

Lives in the database

Uses procedures instead of APIs

Uses parameters instead of buttons
