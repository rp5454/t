First, what this really means (in reality)

Master data =

Chart of Accounts

Cost centers

Business units

Source identifiers

Entity codes

Configuration =

Which sources are active

Which periods can run

Which logic applies to which source

Run windows, flags, parameters

Reporting consistency =

Same account means same thing everywhere

Same calculation logic across all reports

Same numbers across Finance, Audit, Management


What happens if you don’t maintain this?
Real-world failure scenarios (not theory)
❌ Scenario 1: Same account shows different numbers

“Operating Expense” differs between:

Tax report

Management dashboard

CFO asks: “Which one is correct?”

Answer: “Depends which job ran last.”

➡️ Trust in system collapses

❌ Scenario 2: Source system mis-mapped

Bank A posts to wrong function

Costs appear under wrong department

Budget vs Actual becomes meaningless

➡️ Wrong decisions are made

❌ Scenario 3: Config change not controlled

Someone enables a source accidentally

Partial data enters production

KPIs spike or crash overnight

➡️ PSS incident + finance escalation

In simple words:

Master data + config are the “constitution” of the finance system.
Transactions are just citizens following those laws.






What YTD (Year-to-Date) and MTD (Month-to-Date) mean practically
Term	What it means
MTD	Only current month values
YTD	Accumulated values from year start

Real practical reasons for separation
1️⃣ Performance & scalability

YTD data is large

MTD data is small

Mixing them slows the system massively

2️⃣ Accounting correctness

Some values are:

Additive (revenue)

Non-additive (rates, margins)

MTD logic ≠ YTD logic

3️⃣ Restatement control

If March is corrected:

Only YTD from March onward must change

MTD for other months remains untouched

This is impossible without separation.

4️⃣ Reporting requirements

Tax → mostly YTD

Management → often MTD

Forecast → hybrid

Each needs independent accuracy.





Restatement = correcting already reported financial data
This can happen due to:

Late postings

Audit adjustments

Accounting rule changes

Source system corrections

Human errors

Why restatements are unavoidable

In real finance:

Data is never final on day one

Audits happen months later

Regulations change

So systems must support correction, not resist it.
What happens without proper restatement handling?
❌ Scenario

April numbers already reported

May correction arrives for April

System cannot update past data

Result

Manual Excel adjustments

Shadow reporting

Audit red flags

Loss of regulatory credibility

How NFRP handles restatement :

✔ Source-wise restatement
✔ Period-wise restatement
✔ Controlled batch window
✔ Restartable processing
✔ Full logging

This ensures:

Only impacted data is recalculated

No accidental overwrites

Historical correctness is preserved
